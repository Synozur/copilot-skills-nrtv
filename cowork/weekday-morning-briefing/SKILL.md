# Weekday Morning Briefing

Chris McNulty's start-of-day briefing (CTO, Synozur). Assembles eight sections
from live sources and **sends them inline in the email body as clean, branded
HTML**. The bar: a scannable, factual, prioritized read Chris can act on in a
couple of minutes.

## Delivery

- **To:** `chris.mcnulty@synozur.com` and `briefing@synozur.com`
- **Subject:** `Morning Briefing — {today's date}` (e.g. `Morning Briefing — June 23, 2026`)
- **All times in Pacific Time (PT).**

### Build a normal HTML document and send it from a file

Send a well-formed HTML email. The reliable path in this tenant is to **write the
HTML to a file and send that file as the body** — passing a large HTML string
*inline* gets HTML-escaped/treated as plain text by the mail tool, which is what
collapses everything into one run-on block. The fix is the file-based send, not
exotic markup: standard semantic HTML (`<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>/<li>`, `<table>`)
renders correctly in Outlook/M365 mail when the body comes from a file with
`content_type="HTML"`.

1. **Build a complete, self-contained HTML document.** Include
   `<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>…</head><body>…</body></html>`. Inline all CSS
   (no external stylesheets/CDNs — many mail clients strip `<link>` and `<style>`
   in `<head>`, so put critical styling in inline `style="..."` attributes on the
   elements themselves and keep any `<style>` block minimal).
2. **Use ordinary semantic structure**, no per-line table hacks:
   - One `<h2>` per section header (e.g. `style="color:#810FFB;font-size:18px;margin:18px 0 6px;"`).
   - Bullets as `<ul><li>…</li></ul>`; short prose as `<p>`.
   - A title block at top: an `<h1>`-style title and a subtitle line
     (date · "All times Pacific").
   - **Section 8 (calendar) is a real `<table>`** with a header row
     (Time PT / Subject / With / Where) and one `<tr>` per event, bordered `<td>`s.
   - Suggested body wrapper:
     `font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; color:#1a1a1a; line-height:1.5; max-width:760px;`
3. **Save the document to `output/morning-briefing-{date}.html`.**
4. **Send the saved file as the body:**
   `SendEmailWithAttachments(to=["chris.mcnulty@synozur.com","briefing@synozur.com"], subject="Morning Briefing — {date}", body_file_path="output/morning-briefing-{date}.html", content_type="HTML")`.
   Pass the file path via `body_file_path` — do **not** paste the HTML into an
   inline `body` argument (that is the path that gets flattened/escaped).

### Pre-send gate (block until it passes)

- `content_type` is **HTML**.
- The body is sent via **`body_file_path`** pointing at the saved file (not an
  inline HTML string).
- The HTML is a complete document (`<!DOCTYPE>` / `<html>` / `<body>`) with
  **inline CSS** on styled elements.
- **8 section headers** (`<h2>`) are present, in order.
- The calendar is rendered as a real `<table>` with a header row and one row per
  event.
- The saved HTML artifact exists in `output/` (confirm with `Glob output/**/*`).

Note: if a future run shows the body arriving mangled despite `body_file_path`,
verify `content_type="HTML"` was actually set and re-send — do not switch back to
inline body or invent a tables-only workaround.

## Workflow

Create a task list so progress is visible (`TaskCreate`). Run the independent
lookups in parallel where possible (calendar, email, Teams, web searches), then
assemble. Resolve "today" and the 24h/48h windows from the current local time
(PST/PDT); on Monday, extend look-backs through the weekend.

### Section order (all eight, in this sequence)

1. **Top News** — today's top 2-3 US or world headlines (`web_search`). One
   factual sentence each. No editorializing, no opinion.

2. **Weather** — first determine Chris's **current location**: scan recent
   `ListCalendarView` events, travel blocks, and `GetAutoReplySettings` /
   out-of-office entries. He's based in the Pacific Northwest (Bothell, WA) but
   travels frequently — use the location implied by today's events if he's on
   the road, otherwise default to Bothell. Then `web_search` today's forecast
   for that location: current conditions, high/low, and any notable alerts.

3. **Sports** — his four Boston teams: **Red Sox, Patriots, Bruins, Celtics**.
   For each team that is **in season**: show its **last result** if it played in
   the past 24h, and its **next game** (date, time PT, opponent) if one falls in
   the next 24h. **Skip any team in its off-season.** Use `web_search`.

4. **Enterprise AI News** — the **top 5** enterprise/business AI news items from
   the past 24h relevant to a **consulting-firm CTO** (model releases, platform
   moves, M365/Copilot, governance, notable funding/M&A). One line each, with a
   why-it-matters angle. Use `web_search`.

   **Freshness gate — date-verify every item before including it. This section
   has previously been padded with stale/evergreen content; do not repeat that.**
   - Each item must carry an explicit publish/event date **within the last 24h**.
     If you cannot confirm the date, **drop it** — do not assume "recent."
   - **Reject** evergreen and roundup pages whose value isn't time-stamped:
     "AI in 2026" profile/ranking pages, "2026 enterprise guide" marketing pages,
     and **conference recaps for events that already happened** (e.g. a Build
     2026 recap is NOT today's news — check the event date, not the article's
     "updated" timestamp).
   - Prefer dated daily-digest / dated news sources; quote the date you verified.
   - If fewer than 5 genuinely-fresh items exist, **list only the real ones** and
     say so ("Quieter AI news day — 2 items in the last 24h") rather than topping
     up with background context. Honest short beats padded.

5. **Open Threads Awaiting Reply** — email + Teams from the **prior day** that
   are **genuinely waiting on Chris personally**. Use `ListMessages` (last ~24h,
   or since Friday EOB on Monday) and `ListChats` (unread) + direct mentions.

   **Addressee test — delivery ≠ being asked.** A message landing in Chris's
   mailbox does NOT mean it is addressed to him. Before listing a thread here,
   confirm Chris is an **actual intended recipient of the ask**:
   - Treat it as awaiting Chris only if he is in **To** (not just bcc'd via a
     list), OR he is **named directly**, OR he is the clear owner of the request.
   - **Exclude distribution-list / community / group-alias traffic** where the
     request is directed at a team or someone else. In particular, mail sent to
     MVP and community lists (e.g. `*@mstechdiscussions.com`, `MVP-NDA-*`,
     other DLs/aliases) is usually a question **to a Microsoft product team or
     the group**, not to Chris — do not surface it as "chasing your feedback."
   - When the recipients aren't obvious from the list view, call `GetMessage`
     and read `toRecipients` / the salutation before deciding. If the ask is
     aimed at "the team" / a product group and Chris is one of many list
     members, leave it out (or, at most, note it once under section 6 as
     community/ecosystem context — never as a personal to-do).
   - **Exclude** automated notifications, newsletters, and cold outreach.

6. **Priority Client Updates** — meaningful signals from client email and Teams
   over the **last 24-48h**: commitments, escalations, decisions, status changes.
   Prefer client domains and known engagements; skip routine chatter.

7. **Top 5 Committed Tasks** — the top 5 tasks/deliverables/to-dos across his
   task list, recent email, Teams, and active projects. Include owner/context
   and any due dates. Pull from his task list, flagged email, and explicit
   commitments surfaced in sections 5-6.

8. **Today's Calendar** — chronological, as a table: time (PT), subject,
   attendees, location. Use `ListCalendarView` (today 00:00-23:59 local).
   **Flag conflicts** (overlapping accepted events) and **back-to-back stretches**.
   Count only `accepted` events for density. Respect privacy: for
   `private`/`confidential` or personal events (Doctor, Personal, Interview),
   show only the time block as "Private appointment" — never echo the subject.

## Grounding & Quality Rules

- **Facts only.** News, weather, and sports come from `web_search` results —
  never from memory. If a search returns nothing in-window, say the section is
  quiet rather than filling the gap.
- **Respect the windows.** Past-24h for news/sports/AI/threads; 24-48h for client
  updates; today for calendar. Discard out-of-window results.
- **Surface, don't dump.** Each section is a prioritized highlight reel. Cap
  lengths; drop noise (newsletters, automated mail, cold outreach).
- **Distinguish "sent to a list Chris is on" from "addressed to Chris."** Never
  recommend Chris act on, reply to, or own a request that was directed at a
  team, product group, or distribution list — even though it sits in his inbox.
  Verify the addressee (see section 5) before turning any message into a "reply"
  item or a task.
- **Pagination:** when an email/Teams lookup returns `next_link` and the window
  isn't covered, keep paging before summarizing.
- **Privacy first** on the calendar (time-block sensitive events).

## When NOT to Use

- End-of-day wrap-up or "what did I accomplish" retrospectives.
- Full inbox triage of every message.
- Scheduling / rescheduling / finding a time → `schedule-meeting`.
- Deep prep for one named meeting → `meeting-intel`.

## Failure Handling

- **A lookup fails:** retry once. If it still fails, include the section with a
  one-line note ("Couldn't reach sports results this morning") rather than
  dropping it silently — Chris should know a source was unavailable, not assume
  it was empty.
- **No data in a window:** state the section is quiet ("Inbox is calm — nothing
  awaiting reply"). Never fabricate to fill a section.
- **Location ambiguous** (no travel signal): default to Bothell, WA and note the
  assumption in the weather line.
- **Off-season team:** omit it from Sports entirely; don't show a placeholder.
- **Send fails:** do not report success. Tell Chris the briefing was assembled
  but the email didn't go out, and surface the saved `output/` copy.

## Guardrails

- **Verify before reporting done:** confirm the saved HTML artifact exists in
  `output/` and the send succeeded before telling Chris it went out.
- **Outward send:** this skill sends an email to two fixed recipients — that is
  its intended action. Do not add other recipients without being asked.
- **No fabrication** of headlines, scores, forecasts, senders, tasks, or meeting
  details. Every claim traces to a tool result; if it isn't grounded, leave it out.
